### Monash Bootcamp Final Project

# JamSoft Ticketing

This is the final project developed for the Monash University Coding Bootcamp. 
All code was written and developed by myself (James Rudd)

The intent behind this project was to develop a reactive ticketing system based off of ITIL methadoligies.
I want to build this from the ground up to be incredibly responsive and user friendly. This means that it needs to be able to load information quickly to prevent performance issues. It also needs to be easy to use, with a simple interface for logging tickets from a client side and a streamlined administration portal for Managers and Team Leads.
